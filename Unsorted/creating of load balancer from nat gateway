Host a Website Using Nginix and private subnets.

1.	We will follow all steps from [previous question](https://github.com/Vaibhav-Shewale/fdec/blob/main/Unsorted/Hosting%20a%20websie%20from%20Private%20Subnet).
2.	Go to public security group Edit Inbound and add “All ICMP IPV4” as target and select “My IP" in source and save rules.
3.	Go to private security group Edit Inbound and add “All ICMP IPV4” as Type and search the security group of public security group and save the rule.
4.	Open first private subnet (i.e. 192.168.3.0/24).
5.	Open your public ec2 (Your Jumper Server, 192.168.0.0/16 ). Update the system if not done (sudo yum install update -y). install the server, here we are using Nginx (sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y). 
6.	Now open the Nginx config file (sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.config). If you think you would made some mistake create a copy of the file. (sudo cp  /etc/nginx/nginx.config /etc/nginx/nginx_original.config).
7.	After the http directives add server details and in server add server name and location.
```
http {
	upstream backend {
			server private_ip;
			server private_ip;
			}
.
.
.
Server {
		listen	80;
		listen	[::]80;
		server_name	public_ip
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://backend;
			}
.
.
.
}
```
8.	Save the nginx config file and restart it. (sudo systemctl restart nginx).
9.	Now login to private subnet (here we will go to 192.168.3.0/24). 
10.	Update the system and install httpd.
	sudo yum update install
	sudo yum install httpd -y
	sudo systemctl start httpd
	sudo systemctl enable httpd
11.	Now write code for html page that would be interpreted by the browser.
 	touch /var/www/html/index.html ; sudo echo “<h1> hello $(hostname -f)</h1>” > /var/wwww/html/index.html
12.	Logout or log in to another private subnet and repeat the same procedure as before.
13.	Copy the Public ip of public subnet. Paste it on a new tab in browser. 
14.	Press refresh (F5) and see if the page changes. If it is then congratulation if not, check the previous step and tally it with your code.

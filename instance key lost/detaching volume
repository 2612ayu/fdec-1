1.	Check the volume of the running instance.
2.	Stop that instance.
3.	Create a new instance (This instance would be use to take all data from forgotten key instance)
4.	Rename the volume (do it if there are multiple volumes available, it is done so that we can identify the volume attach to that instance)
5.	Detach volume from instance A (forgotten key instance). Detaching of volume can be done in Volume Tab.
6.	Now attach the volume, select the new instance from the drop down menu.
7.	Remove the new volume if required (instance B created a new volume while creating the instance).

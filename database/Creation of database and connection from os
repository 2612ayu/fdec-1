1.	Search for RDS

4.	Select Latest Engine Version (Doesn’t matter if we select old version, later if we update the system, it will also update the engine version).
5.	For templates we will select Free tier (Cause we are still in learning phase but this will block off most of the things).
6.	Give Some name to your Database(We will give it StarBoy).
7.	Add a master password ( we will give Redhat!123 cause ‘@’ is not accepted in this read description of the password).
8.	DB instance we will take is Burstable classes and select db.t3.micro
9.	For Storage type we will select Gp2 and allocated storage to 20 GB and also we will enable auto scaling upto 1000 GB.

19.	Add a new rule type all traffic and in source select the security group that you added for your ec2.

i.	sudo yum list | grep mariadb
ii.	sudo yum install mariadb105.x86_64 -y
22.	Now we can use mariadb. But before that we need to connect with our MariaDb. For that we we will use command.
i.	mysql -h (here will be Endpoint of rds) -u (username of database database) -p
23.	Now we are inside our Database.
24.	Now we will see all the databases present in the database.
i.	show databases;
25.	Now create a database that you want for this we will give our database name ‘Starboy’).

iii.	show tables;
iv.	desc Menu;
27.	We can see our table data that we just have created.
i.	SHOW COLUMNS FROM Menu.
28.	Now our database has been created and as well we setup our table, now comes the main thing is the data. Table consists of data in columns.
i.	INSERT INTO Menu (item, price) VALUES ('Dosa', 200), ('Mendu Vada (1pc)', 179), ('Idli(2pcs)', 98), ('Rava Dosa', 299), ('Noddles(Spicy)', 50),  ('Manchuriyan Gravy(4 pcs)', 300), ('Red Label(90ml)', 900), ('Regal Chiwas(32 years old)(90ml)',25000), ('Old Monk(90ml)', 250), ('Red Wine', 6500), ('Chakna(Complimentary Limited)', 0);
